# ap-csce-code
* All of my code from my APCS class at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST; Alexandria, VA)
* AND MORE
* This course covered many topics that I have used throughout my college carer including sorts, Big O analysis, trees, and graphs
* Though it should be noted I was only 15-16 when I wrote this code so my naming conventions and organization are messy at best
