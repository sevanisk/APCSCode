# ap-csce-code
* All of my code from my APCS class at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST; Alexandria, VA)
* AND MORE
* This course covered many topics that I have used throughout my college carer including sorts, Big O analysis, trees, and graphs
* Though it should be noted I was only 15-16 when I wrote this code so my naming conventions and organization are messy at best
* ***NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS PURELY FOR MY REFERENCE. IF YOU ARE A TJHSST STUDENT PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS CODE. REMEMBER THE HONOR CODE AND KNOW THAT IF YOU COPY THIS CODE THE TJHSST PLAGIARISM CHECKER WILL FIND YOU.***
